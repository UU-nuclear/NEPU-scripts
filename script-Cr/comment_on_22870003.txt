from the paper:

	The total inelastic cross-section was obtained as described in Ref. [4] using the measured
	integral gamma production cross-sections. Up to 3.771 MeV excitation energy, only four transi-
	tions contribute to the total inelastic cross-section: 1434.07 keV, 1530.67 keV, 1727.53 keV and
	2337.44 keV (Ref. [43]). The 1530.67 keV, 1727.53 keV and 2337.44 keV transitions were used
	with the appropriate branching factor to compensate for the fact that the transitions 2965.0 keV,
	3161.8 keV and 3771.7 keV are too weak to be observed in our experiment. According to the
	adopted level scheme, the next excited level above 3771.7 keV that decays directly to the ground
	state is at 3951.2 keV. This leads to the conclusion that the total inelastic cross-section shown
	here (Fig. 14) is exact up to about 4.0 MeV neutron energy. Above this value it has to be consid-
	ered as a lower limit. In the case of the 52Cr, the majority of the excited levels decay through the
	first excited level so this limit is very close to the exact value

So, we should truncate this data set at 4 MeV. It is a shame to do this, though.
